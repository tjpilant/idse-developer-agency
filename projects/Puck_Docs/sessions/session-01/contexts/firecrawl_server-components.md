Integrating Puck — React Server Components

# React Server Components

Puck provides support for React Server Components (RSC), but the interactive-nature of Puck requires special consideration.

## Environments

### Server

Puck supports the server environment for the following APIs:

- The `<Render>` component, for rendering pages produced by Puck
- The `resolveAllData` lib, for running all data resolvers
