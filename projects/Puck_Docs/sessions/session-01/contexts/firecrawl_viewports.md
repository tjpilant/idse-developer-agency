Integrating Puck — Viewports

# Viewports

The Puck preview renders in a same-origin iframe that can be resized to simulate different viewports.

## Default viewports

Puck provides 3 viewports by default:

1. Small: 360px wide
2. Medium: 768px wide
3. Large: 1280px wide

Each of the default viewports have 100% height, filling the available space (via the `auto` height parameter).
