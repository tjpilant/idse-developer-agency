Session: IDSE_Core / session-1765806980
Owner: tjpilant
Status: CLOSED
Governance: validate-artifacts PASS · check-compliance OK · audit-feedback OK
Summary:
Short closeout: scaffold completed for IDSE_Core session; core artifacts (intent, context, spec, plan, tasks) created and governance validators passed. Some upstream placeholders flagged by the fallback script; see scripts-validate.log for details.

Artifacts produced:
- intents/projects/IDSE_Core/sessions/session-1765806980/intent.md
- contexts/projects/IDSE_Core/sessions/session-1765806980/context.md
- specs/projects/IDSE_Core/sessions/session-1765806980/spec.md
- plans/projects/IDSE_Core/sessions/session-1765806980/plan.md
- plans/projects/IDSE_Core/sessions/session-1765806980/test-plan.md (expected)
- tasks/projects/IDSE_Core/sessions/session-1765806980/tasks.md
- implementation/projects/IDSE_Core/sessions/session-1765806980/README.md
- reports/projects/IDSE_Core/sessions/session-1765806980/*

Key decisions & next steps:
- Governance suite shows PASS for core validators; fallback validator reports missing detailed sections (intent/spec/plan/test-plan/tasks). Recommend filling required sections before final publication.
- Next: decide whether to remediate placeholders now (I can propose text) or track as backlog items in CHANGELOG.
