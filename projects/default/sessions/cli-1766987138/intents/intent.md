Our intent is to allow for the use of Puck Editor and Storybook to prototype UI/UX components. We will store the Shadnd and Tailwind CSS class and component information in Supabase. This will aid in our ability to produce website pages through converting Puck Editor JSON output into JavaScript React and HTML code for use by the IDE team. Additionally, we will create the Agency Swarm Constitution so the IDE team can develop agents for Agentic projects around that framework in VSCode (Cursor).
