# Context

## Technical Environment

- Repository: projects-root canonical layout under `projects/RemapTest/sessions/remap-session/`.
- Governance: Article X projects-root canonical; legacy stage-root allowed only during grace.
- Tooling: SessionManager bootstrap, migration script, validators in projects-root mode.

## Constraints and Risks

- Validators will fail if required artifacts are missing.
- Legacy paths should not be used for new work.

## Open Questions

- None for this bootstrap validation pass.
