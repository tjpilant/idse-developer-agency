# Implementation Plan

## Phases

1. Bootstrap documents in projects-root layout for RemapTest.
2. Run validators in projects-root mode and address findings.
3. (Optional) Remove or ignore any legacy stage-root files after validation.

## Tasks

- Ensure all required stage files exist with minimal content.
- Execute validation commands and review reports.
