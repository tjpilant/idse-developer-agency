# Claude Prompt Overload Note

- A long pasted UI snippet caused Claude to hit a "prompt too long" error.  
- When sharing reference UI code, attach smaller chunks or link to files in the repo.  
- If a prompt overloads, trim to the minimal components needed and resend, or point to the saved file path.  
- For future 3-column shell work, the relevant files live under `frontend/widget/src/ui/` and `frontend/widget/src/puck/`—refer to those paths instead of pasting full code blocks.
