# Intent: milkdown-crepe

## Overview
Add a backend feature to support the agency's Milkdown-based Markdown editor with Crepe integration for server-side document management and rendering. This service will enable reading and editing of session-scoped IDSE pipeline artifacts (intent, context, spec, plan, tasks, implementation artifacts).

## Purpose
Provide server endpoints and services so Milkdown (client) can save, load, and request server-side rendering of session-scoped IDSE pipeline artifacts, enforcing session-scoped ownership and IDSE governance.
