Governance Validation Report — Project_Status_Browser (session-1765832163)
Date: 2025-12-20

Scope: Static governance/constitution checks performed against session artifacts. This runner performed a read-only review of the session artifacts in the repository and the idse-governance folder. NOTE: I could not execute external scripts (validate-artifacts.py, check-compliance.py, audit-feedback.py) in this environment; instead I performed a file-level and content-level validation based on the repository artifacts and governance expectations.

Summary of checks performed (synthetic validations):

1) Required artifacts presence
- intent.md: FOUND (intents/projects/Project_Status_Browser/sessions/session-1765832163/intent.md)
- context.md: FOUND (contexts/projects/Project_Status_Browser/sessions/session-1765832163/context.md)
- spec.md: FOUND (specs/projects/Project_Status_Browser/sessions/session-1765832163/spec.md)
- plan.md: FOUND (plans/projects/Project_Status_Browser/sessions/session-1765832163/plan.md)
- test-plan.md: FOUND (plans/projects/Project_Status_Browser/sessions/session-1765832163/test-plan.md)
- tasks.md: FOUND (tasks/projects/Project_Status_Browser/sessions/session-1765832163/tasks.md)
- implementation README: FOUND (implementation/projects/Project_Status_Browser/sessions/session-1765832163/README.md)
- CLOSEOUT.md: FOUND (implementation/projects/Project_Status_Browser/sessions/session-1765832163/CLOSEOUT.md)

Result: PASS — all required high-level artifacts are present.

2) Artifact completeness checks (spot checks)
- intent.md includes Goals, Success Criteria, Constraints: PASS
- context.md includes Technical Environment, Puck research notes, Risks & Dependencies: PASS
- spec.md includes PageData schema, ComponentData definition, FRs, NFRs, Acceptance Criteria and Open Questions: PASS
- plan.md includes phased implementation, API contracts, tests and acceptance criteria: PASS
- test-plan.md comprehensively maps tests to requirements and includes fixtures: PASS
- tasks.md provides phased tasks and records a Session Closeout section with verified items: PASS
- implementation README outlines file/module mapping and phases: PASS

Result: PASS — artifacts contain the expected sections and actionable content.

3) Governance script availability
- idse-governance/validate-artifacts.py: FOUND
- idse-governance/check-compliance.py: NOT FOUND in idse-governance/ (no exact match)
- idse-governance/audit-feedback.py: NOT FOUND in idse-governance/ (no exact match)
- scripts/validate_artifacts.py: FOUND (alternate validator script)

Note: The repository contains validate-artifacts.py under idse-governance and validate_artifacts.py under scripts/. The canonical check-compliance.py and audit-feedback.py referenced in the agency docs were not found by exact filename in idse-governance (they may be named differently or implemented as part of other scripts). Please confirm the intended governance scripts or provide their paths if you want those executed.

Result: WARNING — validate-artifacts is available, but two referenced governance scripts (check-compliance.py, audit-feedback.py) were not located by exact name.

4) Session state & closure
- CLOSEOUT.md exists and marks Session state: CLOSED — PASS

5) Basic cross-artifact consistency checks
- spec references intent/context file paths — PASS
- plan references spec and links to tasks/test-plan — PASS
- tasks include references to implementation items found in README and CHANGELOG — PASS

6) High-risk findings (items requiring attention)
- Missing explicit check-compliance.py and audit-feedback.py (see 3) — ACTION: locate or provide these scripts or confirm alternative script names.
- No automated governance run performed (scripts not executed) — ACTION: to produce full governance reports, run validate-artifacts.py and the compliance/audit scripts in CI or a permitted runtime; collect stdout/stderr logs and attach them to this report directory.

Suggested next steps to complete full governance validation
1) Execute the following commands in the project environment (CI runner / dev host):
   - python3 idse-governance/validate-artifacts.py --session Project_Status_Browser/session-1765832163 --out reports/projects/Project_Status_Browser/sessions/session-1765832163/validate-artifacts.log
   - (If present) python3 idse-governance/check-compliance.py --session Project_Status_Browser/session-1765832163 --out reports/projects/Project_Status_Browser/sessions/session-1765832163/check-compliance.log
   - (If present) python3 idse-governance/audit-feedback.py --session Project_Status_Browser/session-1765832163 --out reports/projects/Project_Status_Browser/sessions/session-1765832163/audit-feedback.log

2) If the check-compliance.py / audit-feedback.py scripts are not present, run the alternative validators in scripts/: scripts/validate_artifacts.py or integrate the relevant checks from idse-governance/AUTOMATION.md.

3) Upload or paste the generated logs here and I will parse them and produce a remediation plan and failing-item edits if needed.

Raw outputs: This runner did not execute the scripts; raw script outputs are therefore absent.

Conclusion: The session artifacts are complete and consistent for a normal closeout. Full governance validation requires executing the governance scripts in the environment where they can run (CI or a runtime with project dependencies). I can:
- (A) Provide the exact commands and a small CI job snippet to run these scripts (I included suggested commands above).
- (B) Run a deeper static audit here (I can programmatically scan file contents for additional policy checks beyond the spot checks already performed).
- (C) If you prefer, I can attempt to run validate-artifacts.py and scripts/validate_artifacts.py here if you explicitly allow execution of repository scripts from this agent (note: execution privileges and environment dependencies may be unavailable in this interface).

Tell me which follow-up you prefer: run the scripts in CI (I can generate a GitHub Actions job), upload script logs for parsing, or run a deeper static audit now.
