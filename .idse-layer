# IDSE Governance Layer

This workspace includes an IDSE (Intent-Driven Systems Engineering) Governance Layer.

**Critical Boundary Rule:**
- Agents (Claude, Codex) must NOT write application code into this layer
- Agents must NOT write governance/protocol artifacts into project code directories (src/, lib/, app/, etc.)

**Purpose:**
The `idse-governance/` directory contains IDE-level coordination metadata for Claude ↔ Codex collaboration, including:
- Handoff protocols and templates
- State tracking (which IDE agent is active)
- Feedback and review artifacts

**This is NOT application code.** This is IDE operating system metadata.
