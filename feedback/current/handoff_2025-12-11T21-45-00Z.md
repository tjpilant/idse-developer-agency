# Handoff: Codex → Claude

## Metadata
- Cycle ID: 2025-12-11T21:45:00Z
- From: codex_gpt
- To: claude_code
- Timestamp: 2025-12-11T21:45:00Z
- IDSE Stage: Feedback
- Plan Reference: plans/current/plan.md

## Review Findings
- Handoff protocol and templates are in place; state guard added to RunIdsePipelineTool.
- KB pointers added to artifacts; plan/spec/tasks trimmed to link back to sources.
- State now reflects Codex as active for this review cycle.

## Recommendations
- When resuming, switch `active_llm` back to claude_code (or await new cycle) and continue refinements.
- Consider adding a small tool to set role_change_event and toggle state for future handoffs.

## Validation
- Tests run: none (state update and documentation review only).
- Results: n/a

## State Update
- Set `active_llm = claude_code` after acknowledgement.
- Set `awaiting_handoff = false` remains.
- Update `handoff_cycle_id` as needed for next cycle.
- `active_stage` can move to next active stage when Claude resumes.
