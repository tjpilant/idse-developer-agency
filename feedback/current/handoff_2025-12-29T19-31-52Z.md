# Handoff: Codex → Claude

## Metadata
- Cycle ID: 2025-12-29T19-31-52Z
- From: codex_gpt
- To: claude_code
- Timestamp: 2025-12-29T19:59:00Z
- IDSE Stage: Implementation
- Plan Reference: plans/projects/IDSE_Core/sessions/milkdown-crepe/plan.md

## Review Findings
- Docs aligned to local-first write mode: intent/spec/plan/tasks/context updated; optional PR mode is now explicitly gated; WRITE_MODE=local default.
- Feedback doc refreshed (removed placeholders, added decisions/actions); backend README notes the admin shell (Puck + Status Browser via frontend/widget).
- Status Browser confirmed in-shell; plan to add “MD Editor” tab and content bridges (markdown embed, optional copy-to-Puck).
- Governance check `validate-artifacts.py --project IDSE_Core --session milkdown-crepe` passes; report at reports/IDSE_Core_milkdown-crepe_1767037953/validate-artifacts-report.txt.

## Recommendations
- Implement MD Editor tab in Puck shell (`VITE_MD_EDITOR_ENABLED`), reuse local write mode, add “Open in MD Editor” links from Status Browser.
- Add read-only Markdown Embed block (render endpoint) as first content bridge; design one-way copy-to-Puck action if desired.
- Keep PR mode off until explicitly needed; if enabling, add GitHub token config and CI PR checks.
- Assign Dev Team reviewer for ACL/sanitizer review; fix datetime.utcnow warning in governance scripts.

## Validation
- Tests run: validate-artifacts.py (session)
- Results: PASS

## State Update
- Set `awaiting_handoff = true`, `active_llm = claude_code` in idse-governance/state/state.json. Awaiting Claude acknowledgment.
